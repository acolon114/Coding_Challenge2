// Task 1: Calculate the Tip
let bill= 100; // Assigns bill 
let tip;

50 <= bill && bill <= 300 ? tip = 0.15 : tip = 0.2; // Output: Tells program that if the bill is inbetween $50-$300 then the tip is 15%, if not then it is 20%

tip = bill * tip; // Output: This line will determine the cost of the tip
